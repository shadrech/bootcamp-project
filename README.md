## Setup

There are a few dependencies to the app. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are required to run the MongoDB database. The api runs on Node (v7.10.1 and NPM v5), the app runs best with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
Once the repo has been cloned run
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
in the root directory run start up the docker image. Once that is done, run
```bash
$ cd api/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
to start the api server on http://localhost:8000.
Once that is done open up a new terminal tab and navigate into the app directory and start the React app
```bash
$ cd app/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The React app will be running on http://localhost:3000
